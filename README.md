# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of a linear regression model for predicting house prices. The model is built using Python and the popular machine learning library, scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is not provided in this repository. However, you can easily replace it with your own dataset or find similar datasets online. The notebook assumes that the dataset contains relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc., along with corresponding house prices.

## Usage
To run the notebook locally, make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, open the Jupyter Notebook `House_Price_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided within.

## About the Model
The model implemented in this notebook uses a simple linear regression approach to predict house prices based on the input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house prices).

## Contribution
Contributions to improve the implementation or provide additional insights are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
